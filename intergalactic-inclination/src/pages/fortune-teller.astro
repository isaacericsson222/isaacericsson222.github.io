            As you enter the smaller pale purple tent the air stills. On a small
            oak table in the center sits a crystal ball coated in frost. The
            inside of the tent is pitch black and looking up you see what could
            be a pattern of constallations or start however as you blink it gets
            difficult to distinguish from the tent. You get both the feeling
            that someone was just here and that you are being watched.
