                As you enter the smaller pale purple tent the air stills. On a small
                oak table in the center sits a crystal ball coated in frost. The
                inside of the tent is pitch black and looking up you see what could be
                a pattern of constallations or start however as you blink it gets
                difficult to distinguish from the tent. You get both the feeling that 
                someone was just here and that you are being watched.
